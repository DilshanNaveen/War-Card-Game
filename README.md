# War Card Game iOS App

This repository contains the War Card Game iOS App that I created to learn Swift and Xcode by referencing a YouTube video tutorial. This app is a practice project that I worked on to gain practical experience with Swift and Xcode.

## About the War Card Game

War is a classic card game that is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The game is usually played between two players, and the objective is to win all the cards.

## Getting Started

To use this app, you will need Xcode installed on your Mac. You can download Xcode from the App Store or from the [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

To run the app, simply open the project in Xcode and build it. You can then run the app on the iOS Simulator or on a physical iOS device.

## How to Play

When you run the app, you will see the main screen with two buttons: "Play" and "Reset". To start a new game, simply tap the "Play" button. The app will deal the cards and show the winner of each round. To reset the game, tap the "Reset" button.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the YouTube channel that provided the tutorial for this project. I learned a lot from this project and I look forward to creating more iOS apps in the future.
